# Metadata Qrs https://metadata-qrs.herokuapp.com/

#### Purpose: As Parity Signer now has support for Substrate based chains including Kusama and Polkadot, we will need to cater for decoding their respective payloads appropriately.

#### Layout
##### v1
1. List of Networks Currently Officially Supported -> Click to get Multipart QR of its calls-only metadata
2. Input Field -> Input wss endpoint for a Substrate node you want metadata for -> get the Multipart QR of its calls only metadata

##### v2
1. Ability to search (when there are many many Substrate chains this will be useful)
